          <h3><ins>Football</ins></h3>
          Football has been a lifelong passion for me since childhood.
          I fondly remember kicking around a worn-out ball in the backyard, pretending to be a superstar on the world
          stage.
          As I grew, my love for the game strengthened. While I never pursued it professionally, football remains a
          cherished hobby, offering moments of joy and excitement, serving as an escape from the everyday grind.
          Whether playing with friends or watching major matches on TV, football holds a special place in my heart.

          <h3><ins>Painting</ins></h3>
          My deep passion for painting serves as a relaxing and safe side hobby.
          When I pick up a brush, I enter a world of endless creativity and self-expression, applying this mindset to
          everything I do.
          Painting allows me to translate my thoughts, emotions, and the beauty of the world onto a blank canvas.
          Despite being a side hobby, it holds a primary place in my heart.
          Each artwork is a labor of love, representing a personal journey that reflects my concealed feelings and
          observations.
          Below are a few completed artworks.

          <h2>The Beautiful Game</h2>
          <p>"To me it represents how all the chaos around the world can be brought together and be put aside whilst the
            beautiful sport is being played, for the love of the game. Football has always been a part of life as it
            puts me in my comfort zone

          <h2>PEACE</h2>
          <p>"To me it represents how everyone around the world can put their differences aside making the world a
            better place, showing a sign of togetherness and oneness. For me working together and bonding is important
            as you learn new skills and lightens your mood

          <h2>Reflection is Important</h2>
          <p>"To me it represents my interest in Vincent Van Gogh’s style in how he portrayed his various artworks. The
            bridge represents a guided route which helped to overcome my difficulties I have been through, also showing
            that religion is important referring to the mosque silhouettes under the bridge reflecting into water

          <h2>Looks are Deceiving</h2>
          <p>"To me it shows how looks can be deceiving and that not everyone may seem or be as what they say they are,
            sometimes it’s not always as it appears to you. The man sees a women who shows interests in him, but he does
            not see what is underneath the water, being blinded by what’s in front of him"</p>
