          I'm Uthmaan Samsodien, a 21-year-old  intern at Life Choices in Cape Town, South Africa.

          <h3><ins>Football</ins></h3>
          Football has been a lifelong passion for me since childhood.
          I fondly remember kicking around a worn-out ball in the backyard, pretending to be a superstar on the world stage. 
          As I grew, my love for the game strengthened. While I never pursued it professionally, football remains a cherished hobby, offering moments of joy and excitement, serving as an escape from the everyday grind.
          Whether playing with friends or watching major matches on TV, football holds a special place in my heart.

          <h3><ins>Painting</ins></h3>
          My deep passion for painting serves as a relaxing and safe side hobby. 
          When I pick up a brush, I enter a world of endless creativity and self-expression, applying this mindset to everything I do. 
          Painting allows me to translate my thoughts, emotions, and the beauty of the world onto a blank canvas. 
          Despite being a side hobby, it holds a primary place in my heart. 
          Each artwork is a labor of love, representing a personal journey that reflects my concealed feelings and observations. 
          Below are a few completed artworks.
