          <h3><ins>Football</ins></h3>
          From the first time that I can remember when I was a child, football has been a passion that's grown into life.
          I recall those early days when I'd kick around a worn-out ball in the backyard, pretending I was a superstar on
          the world stage.
          As I grew, my love for the game only grew stronger and stronger.
          Though I never pursued football professionally, it remains a cherished hobby that has brought me countless
          moments of joy.
          It's a source of pure excitement and an escape from the everyday grind. Whether it's playing with friends at the
          local park or watching the biggest matches on TV, football has a place in my heart.

          <h3><ins>Painting</ins></h3>
          I have passion for painting art which runs deep, and it's a side hobby that helps me relax and puts me in a safe
          place.
          From the moment I pick up a brush and touch it to a canvas, I enter a world of endless creativity and
          self-expression, and this is the mindset I have when doing anything I do.
          The act of painting allows me to translate my thoughts, emotions, and the beauty of the world around me onto a
          blank surface.
          While it may be a side hobby, it's anything but secondary in my heart. Every piece I create is a labor of love,
          a personal journey that speaks to my concealed feelings and observations.
          And below are a few of my artworks that I have completed.
